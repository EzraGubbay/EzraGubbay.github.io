# What is a system?

## Levels of Organization - From Smallest to Largest

1.  Cell - The smallest life form. There are additional forms of “pseudo-life” that are smaller, but these are generally not independent of cellular/multicellular life forms.
2. Tissue
3. Organ
4. System - A network of connected or related organs.
5. Organism

## Body Tissues

A group of cells that have similar structure and function together as a unit.

## Systems

There are many systems of interconnected organs in the human body, such as the cardiovascular, limbic and nervous systems.

# Homeostasis

A kind of **balance of life** that all living organisms strive for, while the universe generally tends to chaos or unbalance.

For example, the human body attempts to preserve some range of internal temperature, sweating during when too hot and shivering when too cold.

## Denaturation

A term from Thermodynamics; the process where some object changes irreversibly, and perhaps loses the functions of proteins and the object / organism.

Like an egg being turned into an omelette with enough heat, the human body attempts to prevent something like this by retaining a balanced internal body temperature.

# The Nervous System

Using electricity, the nervous system propels signals throughout the body in the units that comprise it, called *neurons*.

Neurons exist primarily in the brain, but also all throughout the body.

## General Functions of the Nervous System

1. Sensory - Detects internal (stomach pain) and external (cool air on the skin) stimuli.
2. Integrative - Processes and interprets sensory input.
3. Motor - Activates muscles or glands (releasing saliva in preparation for sensory visual detection of food about to be eaten).

# Peripheral vs. Central Nervous Systems

The human nervous system splits into two primary sections:
- Peripheral - The sensory and motor divisions.
- Central - The brain and spinal cord.

The Peripheral System further splits into two additional parts:
- “Fight-or-flight”
- “Rest-and-digest”

For conservation of energy and resources, the peripheral system keeps certain parts active during non-stressful, calm situations, and turns these off in favor of other systems necessary for survival in high-stakes cases (such as being chased by a lion, or sprinting to reach the bus in time).

# Deep-Dive: Central Nervous System

# The Brain

- Cereberum - Largest portions and associated with higher mental functions - contains all abilities that fundamentally sets humans apart from animals (speech, feeling, dreaming etc.)
- Diencephalon - Processes sensory input (temperature, smells).
- Cerebellum - Coordinates muscle activity (operates muscles).
- Brain Stem - What we have in common with most animals (breathing, heartbeat) - can take hold over the actions in emergency situations when there is a perceived threat.

### The Brain Cells

Being the most important organ in the body, the brain is not only comprised of neuronal cells, but also various others (glial) are responsible for transferring energy to the brain, protecting the brain from diseases and damage, etc.

### Glial Cells

There are many varieties of glial cells, such as Oligodendrocytes and Microglial Cells.

## Myelin Sheathe

A protective layer of fat wrapped around the neuron, ensuring proper delivery and channeling of electric signals through the cell.

### Demyelination

When the myelin sheathe around a neuron is damaged, this can damage the channeling of the electric signal.
A disease caused by mass demyelination is Multiple Sclerosis, and it tends to hurt functions all over the body.

## Spinal Cord

A central collection of nerves traveling through "windows" in  vertebrae made of bone, such that nerves split off through spaces between the vertebrae in the spine, to their respective destinations in the body.

The spine serves as a protective boney ring around the spinal cord.

## Peripheral Nervous System

Controls many things, including functions of the body that we do not consciously operate, such as breathing, heartbeats, the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems.

It also controls all voluntary skeletal muscles too, and consists of the cranial and spinal nerves.

## Autonomic Nervous System

Aside from operating the heart and lungs, the **ANS** controls **reflexes** as well.

### Example: Jerking back your hand after touching something hot

When a very strong stimulus is receives on nerves, for example when touching something very hot with your hand, the sensory signal will travel up to the spinal cord, thus it is received by the central nervous system.
However before the signal reaches the brain, a strong motor signal is already sent back to the hand, jerking it back. Then the signal is processed by the brain.

This is different from the what happens in most cases, where the brain generally receives a sensory signal and sends back a motor signal in response.

# Nerves

Nerves are cable-like structures in the body, that carry electric signals representing information, be it sensory input or motor commands to the body.

## Anatomy of the Neuron

A neuron is composed of multiple components:
- Axon - A long “tail” that carries that delivers electric signals from the neuron.
- Axon Terminals - The edges of the axon, where connections are made with other neurons, thus sending the electric signal over.
- Soma (cell body) - The “command center” of the neuron, where the DNA is stored, and electric signals are filtered out to either be sent forward or not.
- Dendrites - Short “hands” attached to the Soma, where electric input is received.

### Synapse

There is no direct physical contact between nerves, but a very small space.

At the end of each axon terminal there is a presynaptic axon microtubule. Electric signals reaching these locations, cause a chemical reaction that carries over the electric signal.

These chemicals are known as *neurotransmitters*. To minimize the weakening of the electric signal due to chemical diffusion between the neurons, the synaptic space is quite small.

The electric signal finally arrives at the postsynaptic neuron’s dendrites, to be processed.

Neurons have varying numbers of dendrites and axon terminals. This format of having varying numbers of terminals, and depending on chemical reactions rather than direct contact for electric signal delivery is very useful for making nerve structures, particularly in the brain, more efficient.

This structure allows for modular activation of entire sections of the brain.
Similar to the[[Tutorial 5 - DNA & Transcription - Protein Synthesis Part II | regulatory networks]] from the previous tutorial, this creates functional complexity, with less “units of operations” (i.e. cells for the brain, like genes in the DNA).

## Exploring the Electric Signal in the Neuron

**Signals traveling across neurons are an electric phenomenon, and are caused by a difference in electric potential across the neuronal plasma**.

More specifically, these electric signals are ions traveling across the neuronal membrane.
The difference in action potential allowing for chemical diffusion that enables ions to travel through the neuron is created by *ion pumps*.

There are two types of ion pumps: two diffusers, Potassium ($K^+$ Diffusion) and Sodium ($Na^+$ Diffusion), enabling Potassium to exit and Sodium to enter intracellular space, respectively, and pumps for each ion, creating the opposite effect as the diffusers.

A neuron’s intracellular space has a resting charge of around -70 Coulombs.

These pumps/diffusers require energy to open up and draw in/push out ions, creating a progressive difference in electric potential (called *action potential* in neurons), causing the ions to continue traveling through the neurons and down the axon.

==(*Further reading: Depolarization, Repolarization, Hyperpolarization*)==

==*Q: Does crossing the threshold create the potential necessary for pumps / diffusers to progressively draw in/push out Potassium/Sodium making an electric signal travel down the neuron?*== 

### Stages of Electric Signals in the Neuron

For the neuron to activate and send an electric signal down its axon, it requires a strong enough signal to be received that causes the voltage in the neuron to cross a threshold.
If this threshold is crossed, the neuron is *depolarized*, starting the process whereby Sodium ions are pumped into the cell.
After Sodium ions are pumped in, Potassium ions are pushed out in a process known as *repolarization* (because the voltage in the neuron drops towards its resting level).

![[Screenshot 2025-06-09 at 13.35.20.png]]
Following an activation of a neuron, there is a refractory period, called *Hyperpolarization*, relative to the maximum voltage reached in the neuron during signal channeling, where the voltage of the neuron drops below its resting voltage, thus requiring a stronger signal than the previous one to stimulate the neuron successively, for a time.

Below is a depiction of the progression of an electrical signal through a neuron. The diffusion of Potassium and pumping of Sodium create a progressive action potential across the neuron, perpetuating the signal until it reaches the synapse.

## The Synapse

Neurotransmitters are molecules released by the axon terminals following an electric signal, and these affect the postsynaptic neuron, either activating or deactivating it, after being received by dedicated receptors for that neurotransmitter that reside on the postsynaptic dendrites.

### EPSPs vs. IPSPs

*Excitatory Postsynaptics Potentials* raise the electric potential in the neuron, bringing it closer to the threshold required for activation, making the neuron easier to activate.

*Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potentials* decrease the electric potential, “discouraging” neuronal activation.

### What happens to neurotransmitters that do not reach the postsynaptic receptors?

The two main things that may happen to a neurotransmitter in this case:
1. Reuptake - some are drawn back into the presynaptic neuron.
2. Degradation (Diffusion) - these are decomposed.

# Drugs and Their Effects on the Brain

Generally, drugs take the place of some neurotransmitters in the synapse, thus affecting the signal between the neurons.

There are four types of effects drugs can have on neurons:
1. **Block Receptors** -  Blocks the receptors of some neurotransmitters. LSD blocks some postsynaptic receptors from receiving neurotransmitters.
2. **Mimic Neurotransmitters** - Keeps the postsynaptic receptors active. Heroin turns into Morphine, activating the same receptors activated by endorphins.
3. **Increase Neurotransmitter Release** - Neurotransmitters are released at higher levels than they should be. Generally this involves reversing the reuptake mechanism, such that additional neurotransmitters are ejected instead of being reabsorbed. MDMA (Methylenedioxymethamphetamine or ecstasy)
4. **Prevent Reuptake** - Blocks the reuptake for some neurotransmitters, preventing those that were released into the synaptic cleft from being reabsorbed into the presynaptic neuron. This creates more availability of the neurotransmitter, causing increased levels and odds of inhibition or excitation, depending on the function of the neurotransmitter.

**Example:** The black widow’s venom causes the increase of acetylcholine release, at nerve cell synapses, causing overstimulation of muscles.
The venom works through increasing neurotransmitter release, reversing the reuptake process of acetylcholine.

### Addictions

These are essentially a chronic brain disorder, caused by alterations in brain structure and function.

Tolerance for the addictive substance builds over time, requiring increased dosages to produce the same effect.

Chronic drug use reshapes brain learning and memory circuits.

# Brain Pong

An experiment took a group of brain cells in a petri dish, and taught them to play a Pong.

The brain learned to play the game after 10 to 15 games at 15-minutes each game, while it took the AI model DeepMind 5000 such games to learn, albeit the brain’s performance in the games was not as good as DeepMind's.
